# An Introduction to Mathematica's Manipulate[] function

The Mathematica notebook offers a few simple examples using the Manipulate[] function. This is extremely useful for visualising the behaviour of certain functions, as parameters are varied in an interactive manner.

The Mathematica notebook is self-contained and includes 3 examples. 

### Example 1: Elliptic curves

The first use of the Manipulate[] function is an application of 'Seiberg-Witten' geometry, which is one of the research areas I am interested in. We are dealing with a family of elliptic curves, described by a cubic equation:

$$ y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2(U) x - g_3(U)$$
